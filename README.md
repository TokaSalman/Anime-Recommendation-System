## 📖 What is this project about?

This project is a smart Anime Recommendation System built with Python. It uses real user data and anime metadata to suggest shows you might love based on what you (and others) already enjoy.

We combine the power of:
- 🔍 Content-based filtering (recommendations based on genre, type, etc.)
- 👥 Collaborative filtering (recommendations based on user behavior)

## 🧠 Why I built this

Anime is an enormous world — with thousands of titles out there, choosing what to watch next can be overwhelming. I wanted to create a system that mimics how a fellow anime fan might recommend something:  
*"You liked Death Note? Try Code Geass!"*  
*"Into romance with a supernatural twist? Watch Noragami!"*

Now, you can get those recs from code 💡
